# 1) Change-Point-First RCA Agent for Microservices

Modern microservice systems generate **anomaly storms**: one real fault triggers dozens of alerts across downstream services. Teams spend precious minutes chasing **symptoms** instead of the **first cause**, inflating **MTTR** and burning **error budgets**.  
**This project** is an always-on, vendor-agnostic **AI observability agent** that detects the **earliest change** in system behavior, maps how it **propagates** through services, and delivers an **evidence-backed explanation** and **fix suggestions** ‚Äî in real time.

---

## üö© Problem We‚Äôre Solving

- **Slow root-cause analysis (RCA)** in large microservice graphs.  
- **Alert fatigue** (duplication, flapping, symptom noise) hides the true origin.  
- **Static or opaque topologies** make it hard to see how faults spread after a deploy, schema migration, or feature-flag change.

**Consequence:** Engineers lose time pivoting between metrics, logs, and traces; incidents last longer than they should.

---

## ‚úÖ How We Solve It (High Level)

### 1) Change-Point-First Detection
The agent continuously watches **golden KPIs** (latency, errors, saturation) and flags **where the first statistically significant shift occurred**.

### 2) Live Causal/Service Graph
From **distributed traces** and **change events** (deploys/flags/migrations), it maintains a live **‚Äúwho-calls-whom‚Äù** graph with current dependencies.

### 3) Propagation Reasoning
It verifies that **downstream services** show issues **after** the first change, constructing a **cause ‚Üí symptom** path.

### 4) Explainable Incident Card (Real Time)
Posts **one card** (Slack/PagerDuty) with:
- **Ranked suspects + confidence**
- **Timestamps**
- **Affected endpoints / SLO burn**
- **Related logs/traces**
- **What changed**
- **Recommended first fixes** (e.g., rollback last migration)

### 5) On-Demand Investigations
You can ask:  
> ‚Äúanalyze checkout timeouts last 30m‚Äù  
‚Ä¶and the agent reproduces the same **evidence-backed RCA**.

---

## üß™ Example

```

10:06  inventory-db  write latency spikes   (earliest change)
10:07  inventory-svc slows
10:08  cart-api      times out
10:09  checkout      fails

```

**Agent card:**  
> *Earliest change at **inventory-db (10:06)** ‚Üí propagated to **inventory-svc ‚Üí cart-api ‚Üí checkout**. Likely tied to migration **idx-2025-09-29**. Try **rollback** / **rebuild index**.*

---

## üì¶ Project Goals (for this repo)

- Implement continuous **change-point detection** on golden KPIs.  
- Build and refresh a **live service graph** from traces + change events.  
- Correlate **earliest change** with **downstream symptoms** to propose a **propagation path**.  
- Emit an **explainable incident card** with evidence and suggested first actions.  
- Provide **Chat** entry points for **on-demand** investigations.

> This README describes the project concept and goals. See the `/docs` and `/examples` folders (to be added) for setup, datasets, and demos.

## üìà Why This Approach

Most tools group alerts or rely on static maps, which can elevate the **loudest symptom**.  
This agent **leads with time** (the **first** change) and validates a **propagation path** over a **live** dependency graph ‚Äî producing faster, more trustworthy localization.

# 2)  MatchMeWith ‚Äî AI-Powered Expert Matching for Organizations

An AI-powered expert matching system that connects you with the right professionals **inside** your company. MatchMeWith builds a **knowledge graph** and rich **people profiles** by leveraging data from docs, code, tickets, and org systems‚Äîso you can find true match in seconds.

---

## üöÄ What is this project?
MatchMeWith discovers, ranks, and introduces internal experts for a given topic, tech, domain, or system. It understands **skills**, **projects**, **ownership**, and **context** (teams, services, regions), then routes your request to the best-fit people.

---

## üß© The problem
- Org charts and job titles **don‚Äôt reflect real skills** or current work.
- Finding help is slow and noisy; people get **interrupted** repeatedly; **duplicate work** happens.

---

## ü§ñ How the AI agent solves it
1. **Ingests signals** from company structure (titles/teams)/Git (repos/PRs)/tickets (Jira)/wikis(Confluence/Notion)/calendars (availability windows).
2. **Extracts skills & domains** using NLP (entity/skill mining, topic modeling) and links them to people/projects.
3. **Builds a knowledge graph** of *people ‚Üî skills ‚Üî projects ‚Üî systems* and a vector index for semantic search.
4. **Matches & ranks experts** by evidence (recent commits, tickets closed, docs authored), **context fit** (team/product), **availability**, and **responsiveness**.
5. **Introduces with context**: sends a brief to you and the expert (why they‚Äôre a match, top links, recent work) and collects feedback to improve future rankings.

# 3) üõ°Ô∏è Data Privacy Guardian Agent

An **Agentic AI system** that autonomously monitors enterprise **data pipelines and databases** to detect, prevent, and remediate **PII leaks** or **non-compliant data flows** (e.g., exporting customer data without anonymization).  
Designed to help enterprises stay compliant with **GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS**, and other regulations.  

---

## üöÄ Problem

Enterprises process massive amounts of sensitive data (emails, SSNs, credit cards, health records).  
- **Developers and analysts** may unknowingly expose raw customer data.  
- Current compliance checks are **manual, slow, and reactive**.  
- Violations can lead to **multi-million-dollar fines** and reputational loss.  

---

## üí° Solution

The **Data Privacy Guardian Agent**:  
- **Continuously monitors** data pipelines, queries, and exports.  
- **Detects sensitive PII/PHI** using ML + pattern detection.  
- Applies **policy-as-code** to enforce compliance.  
- Takes **autonomous actions**: mask, encrypt, block, or quarantine data.  
- Generates **audit-ready reports** for regulators and security teams.  

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./architecture.png)

### **Core Components**
1. **Detection Layer** ‚Üí Regex + ML (Presidio, spaCy, HuggingFace) for PII/PHI.  
2. **Classifier for Unstructured Data** ‚Üí NLP/Embeddings to catch hidden PII in logs, notes, etc.  
3. **Policy Engine** ‚Üí Compliance rules encoded with OPA/Sentinel.  
4. **Risk Scoring** ‚Üí Context-aware severity based on lineage, destination, and user role.  
5. **Action Executor** ‚Üí Applies masking, encryption, blocking, or quarantining.  
6. **Audit & Evidence Store** ‚Üí Immutable logs + Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) reports.  

### **Control Plane**
- **Admin Console** ‚Üí Dashboards for monitoring and policy management.  
- **IAM & Secrets** ‚Üí Role-based access + KMS/HSM integration.  
- **SIEM/SOAR** ‚Üí Alerts via Splunk/ELK/Sentinel.  
- **Compliance Packs** ‚Üí Mapped to GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS.  

---

## üîÑ Workflow Example

1. **Analyst runs an export query.**  
2. **Agent intercepts pipeline output.**  
3. **Detection layer finds PII** (e.g., emails, SSNs).  
4. **Policy engine checks compliance rules.**  
5. **Risk scoring decides** if masking/encryption is required.  
6. **Action executor applies transformations** or blocks.  
7. **Audit logs are generated and alerts sent** to SIEM.  

---

## ‚ö° Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Continuous Compliance** ‚Äì Real-time enforcement of GDPR/CCPA.  
- ‚úÖ **Reduced Risk** ‚Äì Prevents PII leaks before they leave the system.  
- ‚úÖ **Audit-Ready** ‚Äì Auto-generates DPIA and compliance evidence.  
- ‚úÖ **Cost Savings** ‚Äì Avoids fines, reduces manual compliance work.
