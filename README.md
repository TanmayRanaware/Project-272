# 1) Change-Point-First RCA Agent for Microservices

Modern microservice systems generate **anomaly storms**: one real fault triggers dozens of alerts across downstream services. Teams spend precious minutes chasing **symptoms** instead of the **first cause**, inflating **MTTR** and burning **error budgets**.  
**This project** is an always-on, vendor-agnostic **AI observability agent** that detects the **earliest change** in system behavior, maps how it **propagates** through services, and delivers an **evidence-backed explanation** and **fix suggestions** ‚Äî in real time.

---

## üö© Problem We‚Äôre Solving

- **Slow root-cause analysis (RCA)** in large microservice graphs.  
- **Alert fatigue** (duplication, flapping, symptom noise) hides the true origin.  
- **Static or opaque topologies** make it hard to see how faults spread after a deploy, schema migration, or feature-flag change.

**Consequence:** Engineers lose time pivoting between metrics, logs, and traces; incidents last longer than they should.

---

## ‚úÖ How We Solve It (High Level)

### 1) Change-Point-First Detection
The agent continuously watches **golden KPIs** (latency, errors, saturation) and flags **where the first statistically significant shift occurred**.

### 2) Live Causal/Service Graph
From **distributed traces** and **change events** (deploys/flags/migrations), it maintains a live **‚Äúwho-calls-whom‚Äù** graph with current dependencies.

### 3) Propagation Reasoning
It verifies that **downstream services** show issues **after** the first change, constructing a **cause ‚Üí symptom** path.

### 4) Explainable Incident Card (Real Time)
Posts **one card** (Slack/PagerDuty) with:
- **Ranked suspects + confidence**
- **Timestamps**
- **Affected endpoints / SLO burn**
- **Related logs/traces**
- **What changed**
- **Recommended first fixes** (e.g., rollback last migration)

### 5) On-Demand Investigations
You can ask:  
> ‚Äúanalyze checkout timeouts last 30m‚Äù  
‚Ä¶and the agent reproduces the same **evidence-backed RCA**.

---

## üß™ Example

```

10:06  inventory-db  write latency spikes   (earliest change)
10:07  inventory-svc slows
10:08  cart-api      times out
10:09  checkout      fails

```

**Agent card:**  
> *Earliest change at **inventory-db (10:06)** ‚Üí propagated to **inventory-svc ‚Üí cart-api ‚Üí checkout**. Likely tied to migration **idx-2025-09-29**. Try **rollback** / **rebuild index**.*

---

## üì¶ Project Goals (for this repo)

- Implement continuous **change-point detection** on golden KPIs.  
- Build and refresh a **live service graph** from traces + change events.  
- Correlate **earliest change** with **downstream symptoms** to propose a **propagation path**.  
- Emit an **explainable incident card** with evidence and suggested first actions.  
- Provide **Chat** entry points for **on-demand** investigations.

> This README describes the project concept and goals. See the `/docs` and `/examples` folders (to be added) for setup, datasets, and demos.

## üìà Why This Approach

Most tools group alerts or rely on static maps, which can elevate the **loudest symptom**.  
This agent **leads with time** (the **first** change) and validates a **propagation path** over a **live** dependency graph ‚Äî producing faster, more trustworthy localization.

# 2)  MatchMeWith ‚Äî AI-Powered Expert Matching for Organizations

An AI-powered expert matching system that connects you with the right professionals **inside** your company. MatchMeWith builds a **knowledge graph** and rich **people profiles** by leveraging data from docs, code, tickets, and org systems‚Äîso you can find true match in seconds.

---

## üöÄ What is this project?
MatchMeWith discovers, ranks, and introduces internal experts for a given topic, tech, domain, or system. It understands **skills**, **projects**, **ownership**, and **context** (teams, services, regions), then routes your request to the best-fit people.

---

## üß© The problem
- Org charts and job titles **don‚Äôt reflect real skills** or current work.
- Finding help is slow and noisy; people get **interrupted** repeatedly; **duplicate work** happens.

---

## ü§ñ How the AI agent solves it
1. **Ingests signals** from company structure (titles/teams)/Git (repos/PRs)/tickets (Jira)/wikis(Confluence/Notion)/calendars (availability windows).
2. **Extracts skills & domains** using NLP (entity/skill mining, topic modeling) and links them to people/projects.
3. **Builds a knowledge graph** of *people ‚Üî skills ‚Üî projects ‚Üî systems* and a vector index for semantic search.
4. **Matches & ranks experts** by evidence (recent commits, tickets closed, docs authored), **context fit** (team/product), **availability**, and **responsiveness**.
5. **Introduces with context**: sends a brief to you and the expert (why they‚Äôre a match, top links, recent work) and collects feedback to improve future rankings.

# 3) AI Agent that Converts SBOMs into Prioritized Remediation and VEX Reports

## üö© Background & Motivation

Modern enterprise software is built from thousands of third-party components. When vulnerabilities are discovered in those components, security teams struggle to know:
- Which vulnerabilities matter most right now?  
- Which actually affect our product in context?  
- How do we fix them quickly and document the fix?  

**Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)** are machine-readable ‚Äúingredient lists‚Äù of all components in a product. Standards like **SPDX** and **CycloneDX** define how to generate them. But enterprises often end up with SBOMs as static lists without clear remediation actions.

Meanwhile, signals like:  
- **OSV** (Open Source Vulnerabilities database)  
- **CISA‚Äôs KEV** (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) list  
- **EPSS** (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) probabilities  

provide powerful insight into which flaws are most urgent. **VEX** (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) formats let companies document if a vulnerability really affects them or not.

Despite all these standards, enterprises lack automation to connect **SBOM ‚Üí Risk ‚Üí Remediation**.  
That is the gap our project will address.

---

## üö© Problem Statement

Given an SBOM, enterprises need a system that can:  
- Detect which components have vulnerabilities.  
- Prioritize vulnerabilities by real-world exploitability (KEV, EPSS).  
- Decide whether the vulnerability actually affects the product (VEX reasoning).  
- Suggest or implement concrete remediation (e.g., dependency upgrade).  
- Produce an audit-ready report for managers and compliance teams.  

**Today this is mostly manual, noisy, and error-prone.**

---

## ‚úÖ Project Objectives

We propose to build an **AI-Agent‚Äìbased application** that will:  
- Ingest SBOMs (SPDX/CycloneDX).  
- Query vulnerability databases (OSV, KEV, EPSS).  
- Prioritize risks based on exploitation likelihood.  
- Generate VEX reports (affected / not affected / fixed).  
- Propose remediations (draft pull requests and risk memos).  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Data Sources
- Open-source project SBOMs (generated with Syft or similar tools).  
- OSV API for vulnerabilities.  
- KEV (CISA published list).  
- EPSS scores (public dataset).  

### Agent Design
- **Planner**: Orchestrates lookups and decisions.  
- **Threat Enricher**: Annotates each SBOM component with vulnerabilities, KEV flags, EPSS scores.  
- **Contextualizer**: Produces VEX determinations.  
- **Remediator**: Suggests dependency updates or patches; drafts PRs + reports.  

### Evaluation
- Compare prioritization quality vs. CVSS-only baseline.  
- Measure how many suggested fixes compile/tests pass.  
- Evaluate VEX accuracy with human review.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

- Prototype AI Agent that processes SBOMs and outputs ranked vulnerabilities, VEX statements, and suggested fixes.  
- Demo on several open-source projects.  
- Final Research Paper (academic style) detailing methods, results, evaluation, and limitations.  
- Presentation with live demonstration.  

---

## üìà Expected Outcomes

- Demonstrate that AI agents can **reduce vulnerability noise** by highlighting the few flaws that really matter.  
- Show how **SBOM + KEV + EPSS + VEX** can be integrated end-to-end.  
- Provide a reproducible tool that could be extended for enterprise use.  
- Contribute an academic paper suitable for submission in applied AI/security venues.  

---

## üß™ Example Situation

**Scenario:**  
Your team maintains a web application that depends on several open-source libraries. A new **SBOM** is generated after the latest build.

**SBOM snippet:**
- libraryA v2.4.1  
- libraryB v1.3.0  
- libraryC v4.0.2  

**Agent workflow:**
1. **Threat Enrichment**  
   - OSV lookup: libraryA v2.4.1 has CVE-2025-9999.  
   - KEV flag: CVE-2025-9999 is actively exploited in the wild.  
   - EPSS score: 0.74 (high likelihood of exploitation).  

2. **Contextual VEX Reasoning**  
   - The agent inspects usage of libraryA in your repo.  
   - Determines vulnerable function is used in production code.  
   - Emits a **VEX statement:** *Affected*.  

3. **Remediation**  
   - Finds that libraryA v2.4.5 contains the fix.  
   - Drafts a pull request upgrading libraryA from v2.4.1 ‚Üí v2.4.5.  
   - Runs CI build/tests to confirm compatibility.  

4. **Reporting**  
   - Generates an executive risk memo:  
     > *‚ÄúCVE-2025-9999 in libraryA is exploited in the wild (KEV) with high EPSS risk.  
     Upgrading to v2.4.5 removes exposure. Fix validated in CI.‚Äù*  
   - Updates audit trail with a VEX file showing the issue as **fixed**.  

**Outcome:**  
Instead of seeing dozens of CVE alerts, your team gets a **ranked vulnerability list, a validated PR, and an audit-ready VEX record** ‚Äî cutting through noise and accelerating remediation.

4.Project: Data Privacy Guardian Agent
1. Problem Statement

Enterprises handle massive volumes of sensitive data ‚Äî customer names, emails, SSNs, credit card info, health records, etc.

Regulations like GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and HIPAA (US healthcare) impose strict rules on how Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personal Data (SPD) are stored, processed, and shared.

Current challenges:

Data pipelines often move data between systems (ETL, data warehouses, analytics, ML training). PII sometimes flows without anonymization.

Developers & analysts might unknowingly export customer data in logs, dashboards, or shared datasets.

Manual compliance checks are slow, error-prone, and reactive (issues discovered after violations).

Consequences:

Massive fines (GDPR penalties can reach 4% of global revenue).

Loss of trust, reputational damage.

2. Agentic AI Solution

The Data Privacy Guardian Agent is an autonomous system that:

Monitors data pipelines & databases continuously (ETL jobs, data lakes, APIs).

Detects PII/PHI data patterns (e.g., email addresses, SSNs, credit card numbers, IPs, medical terms).

Context-aware compliance checks:

Is the data anonymized before being exported?

Is it encrypted in storage and transit?

Does the target system meet compliance standards?

Takes autonomous actions:

Blocks risky exports (e.g., CSV with raw PII sent to external S3 bucket).

Suggests or applies anonymization/pseudonymization.

Generates compliance alerts and reports.

3. Workflow Example

üîπ Step 1 ‚Äì Monitoring:
The agent hooks into ETL jobs (Airflow, Snowflake, Kafka, Databricks) and DB queries (SQL logs).

üîπ Step 2 ‚Äì Detection:

Detects sensitive fields like email, ssn, dob, credit_card_no.

Uses ML/NLP to catch hidden PII (e.g., names in free-text fields, addresses in notes).

üîπ Step 3 ‚Äì Compliance Check:

Is this export going to a non-compliant storage (e.g., unsecured S3 bucket)?

Is anonymization applied before ML training dataset generation?

Does data access match the user‚Äôs role-based permissions?

üîπ Step 4 ‚Äì Action:

üö´ Block: Stop a non-compliant export (with logs for audit).

üõ°Ô∏è Fix: Auto-mask sensitive fields before sharing.

üìÑ Report: Generate a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and compliance report.

4. Enterprise Impact

Regulatory Compliance: Prevents violations of GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS.

Risk Reduction: Stops sensitive data leaks before they happen.

Audit Readiness: Auto-generates compliance reports for regulators and auditors.

Cost Savings: Avoids multi-million-dollar fines and reduces manual compliance workload.

Trust: Builds stronger customer confidence by protecting their data.
